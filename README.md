# spotify_data_analysis

This capstone project was a collaboration between me and two classmates, Jiayu Gu and Tianyi Li. We assumed the roles of data scientists at Spotify for this project. The purpose of this project was to understand what makes music popular and to identify the audio features characteristic of specific genres. The first dataset comprised data on 52,000 songs, randomly selected from various genres and sorted alphabetically. The second dataset contained explicit feedback, specifically star ratings, from 10,000 users on 5,000 songs they had listened to, rated on a scale from 0 (lowest) to 4 (highest). Each row in this dataset corresponds to a user, and each column to a song, aligning with the first 5,000 rows (songs) from the previous dataset, in the same order.
